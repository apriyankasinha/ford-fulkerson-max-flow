# Ford Fulkerson Max Flow

`Python code for taking a bipartite graph, reducing it to a max flow graph and finding the maximum flow int he graph.`

Make sure that you're using `networkx==1.9`

#### The goal here is:
1. Take a bipartite graph and transform it into a directed flow network with a source and a sink.
2. Use the Ford Fulkerson method and Breadth For Search to find augmenting paths and calculate the residual graph.
3. Using the residual graph and calculate the flow of each node in the original graph.
